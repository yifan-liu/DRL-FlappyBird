## How to use

### Dependencies:
tensorflow, pygame, opencv-python
installation:
pip install tensorflow
pip install pygame
pip install opencv-python

### Usage:
#### 1. Train
python dqn.py

It loads the model stored in 'saved_networks_dqn' folder, if the model exists, and goes on training
Training from scratch will take at least 8 hours to reach playable network

#### 2. Test
python dqn.py test

It loads the model stored in 'saved_networks_dqn' folder, if the model exists.
But it won't train the model, it just plays the game using the current model.

##### 2.1 Load pre-trained 140k-model
python dqn.py test 140k

It loads the pre trained model in '140k-saved_networks_dqn'.
This model have been trained 140k times of game frame.

##### 2.2 Load pre-trained 200k-model
python dqn.py test 200k

It loads the pre trained model in '200k-saved_networks_dqn'.
This model have been trained 200k times of game frame.

##### 2.3 Load pre-trained 460k-model
python dqn.py test 460k

It loads the pre trained model in '140k-saved_networks_dqn'.
This model have been trained 460k times of game frame.

#### Performance of pre trained model
140k model: Avg Score: ~3
200k model: Avg Score: ~2000
460k model: Avg Score: The bird is godlike, it never dies
